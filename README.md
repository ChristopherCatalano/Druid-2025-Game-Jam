# Night Watch

*A Tower Defense Game for the Druid Mechanics Game Jam*

## Game Overview

Night has fallen, and you have a mission. As one of the child's beloved toys, you must defend your sleeping child from the nightmares that invade his room at night and try to torment his dreams. But you're not alone—you can enlist the help of other toys by building and using them as guard towers to help defend your perimeter and keep the nightmares at bay.

As the night progresses, the nightmares increase in number and become more aggressive, making survival increasingly challenging. See how long YOU can survive the night and protect your child's peaceful dreams.
